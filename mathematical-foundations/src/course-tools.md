# Course Tools

We will use two tools in this course:

+ The [Python programming language](https://python.org) as a subject for our study of program correctness.
+ The [LaTeX documentation preparation system](https://latex-project.org) to author mathematical prose. 

Python is available via straightforward installers on all operating systems:

+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

Additionally, it is available through most platform's package managers, _e.g._, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on Macs.

To develop Python code, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) which features robust support for [developing Python programs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).
Although, any editor of your choice will work!

LaTeX can similarly be installed directly on most platform:

+ <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>

However, the raw edit-and-compilation experience for LaTeX is lacking.
I recommend using the [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) online service for authoring LaTeX documents.
Overleaf has a full-featured, in-browser LaTeX IDE that smooths away many of the warts when developing in LaTeX.
A free Overleaf account is sufficient for both this course and most people's needs.

Additionally, Overleaf provides an excellent introductory tutorial to LaTeX.
I highly recommend you work through it and come back to it as a reference for this course:

+ <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes>

We'll introduce the parts of Python that you need for this course.
However, you should certainly use this time to dig deeper into the language.
I recommend using a comparison resource like Learn X in Y minutes:

+ <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>

That provides a succinct, practical reference for the language as an initial guide and, later, reference when picking up the language.
