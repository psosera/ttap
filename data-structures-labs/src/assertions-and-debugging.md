# Assertions and Debugging

In this lab, we'll practice reasoning about program assertions and then put that knowledge into practice by debugging programs.

While we will write code in today's lab, it will be all in the service of _answering questions about how programs work_.
Consequently, you'll be turning in your answers directly to Gradescope.

## Part 1: Assertions

In these problems, you'll work your ability to reason about program properties and whether they are _preserved_ throughout execution.
Knowing whether a property is preserved within a program is a cornerstone of efficient debugging as we will discuss in the coming days.

### Problem 1a

Consider the following method:

~~~java
public static int foo1(int x1, int x2) {
    // Point A
    if (x1 < 0 || x2 < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    // Point B
    int y1 = x1 % 10;
    int y2 = x2 % 10;
    int z = 0;
    // Point C
    if (y1 < y2) {
        z = y1 - y2;
    } else {
        z = y2 - y1;
    }
    // Point D
    return z;
}
~~~

Now, consider whether each of the propositions holds at the given point in the method all the time (✓), some of the time (?), or none of the time (✗):

*   Point A:
    + `x1 == 0`
    + `x2 < 0`
*   Point B:
    + `x1 == 0`
    + `x2 < 0`
*   Point C:
    + `y1 < 5`
    + `y2 > 0`
*   Point D:
    + `z > y1`
    + `z < 0`

### Problem 1b

~~~java
public static String foo2(String s, char c) {
    String ret = "";
    // Point A
    if (s == null) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(); }
    if (s.length < 2) { return s; }
    // Point B
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        // Point C
        ret += s.charAt(i);
        ret += c;
        // Point D
    }
    // Point E
    return ret;
}
~~~

Now, consider whether each of the propositions holds at the given point in the method all the time (✓), some of the time (?), or none of the time (✗):

|         | `s.length >= 2` | `ret.length() > 0` | `ret.length() % 2 == 0`
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------ | -----------------------
| Point A |                 |                    |
| Point B |                 |                    |
| Point C |                 |                    |
| Point D |                 |                    |
| Point E |                 |                    |

# Part 2: Debugging Practice

To get practice with the debugger, try debugging the following erroneous methods.
Remember to apply the *scientific debugging process* when fixing these methods:

1. Understand the problem with test cases/examples and write the code/understand the code base (if you did not write the code yourself).
2. Run the code against these test cases and discover a bug.
3. Review your assumptions (pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants) that you formed in step 1 and form a hypothesis as to which of these assumptions could have been violated, causing the bug you are witnessing.
4. Use debugging tools to verify or refute this hypothesis.

For each program, you should:

+ Identify the problematic line(s) of code.
+ Describe the problem in a sentence or two.
+ Describe how you fix the problem, in particular, by modifying the identified lines of code or adding new lines.

*(Note: these programs may have more than one bug in them, so test-and-diagnose thoroughly!)*
