In this course, we discuss fundamental data structures and algorithms used in most computer programs. These data structures are complex enough that we would like to build and reason about them independently from our program. To this, we must also build effective abstractions that separate a data structure implementation from how the rest of our program uses it. This need gives us a convenient opportunity to study the object-oriented programming paradigm and the Java programming language as object-orientation provides excellent mechanisms for defining abstractions between the components of a program.
